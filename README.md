# pyside_utils
A place to keep reusabble widgets for python Pyside UI

I've just started getting into Pyside, and ended up creating a widget that is probably useful for more than
just the project I'm working on. So figured I would share it here.
Perhaps I will end up creating more as I go.

## DirectoryBrowser

If you need a way for a user to be able to point-click on files and be able to show special information about that file...
then this class is for you.
